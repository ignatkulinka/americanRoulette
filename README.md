##### Betting
Allows for a user to enter bets. Currently, there are two ways to enter bets. The first is manually. That is, the user can manually select a bet amount and then click on the roulette table to place a bet. The bets can be stacked by clicking the betting spot again to increase bet amount. Another way to bet is to use the random bet generator. First, use the slider to set the number of bets you want to generate and then click the *place random bet* button to automatically add the bets to the roulette table. 

##### Summary
Provides a list overview of the bets that a user has placed. The bets are divided into two tables: Manual and CPU bets. The Reset button allows for the user to clear the table of any bets. In addition, this tab has the **Spin the Roulette** button. This button will generate a random winning slot and output it. Lastly, the Results table will show the user which of the bets won and lost.
