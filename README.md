#### Betting


* **Manual Betting**: allows for a user to enter bets. Here the user can manually select a bet amount and then click on the roulette table to place a bet. To select the bet amount click the button with the corresponding dollar amount. The bets can be stacked by clicking the betting spot again to increase bet amount.

</p>


* **Computer Assisted Betting**: another way to bet is to use the random bet generator. First, use the slider to set the number of bets you want to generate and then click the _**place random bet**_ button to automatically add the bets to the roulette table.
