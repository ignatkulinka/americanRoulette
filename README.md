## Package Requirements

## App Mechanics
**NEW**: Multiple sessions are now allowed! Join others playing on the hosted app or run multiple sessions on your machine/local server. On your local server/machine open multiple windows in your web browser or use R Studio built-in browser as one of the sessions.


`americanRoulette` is divided into parts by tabs on the left and right sides of the screen.

#### Betting


* **Manual Betting**: allows for a user to enter bets. Here the user can manually select a bet amount and then click on the roulette table to place a bet. To select the bet amount click the button with the corresponding dollar amount. The bets can be stacked by clicking the betting spot again to increase bet amount. 
* **NEW**: additionally, the user is allowed to choose the color of the betting chips with the convenient color selector drop-down menu on the left hand side.

</p>


* **Computer Assisted Betting**: another way to bet is to use the random bet generator. First, use the slider to set the number of bets you want to generate and then click the _**place random bet**_ button to automatically add the bets to the roulette table. 


#### Summary

#### Roulette Table
This tab outputs a simulation of the American roulette table. This plot can be clicked to place bets. The clickable spots follow the general official rules for betting. Bets can be stacked on top of each other by clicking them again.

#### Summary Plots
**NEW**: Better plots have been added and the old ones have been overhauled. 

This tab provides a useful insight into the statistics behind the current game session. Monitor the amount of money won/lost, number of bets won, frequency of winning slots and many more. 

#### Data Output
**Warning**: Data download option only functions when the app is open in web browser. At the moment, downloading data from the built-in R Studio browser is not possible.

This tab shows the running list of all the possibly useful data that is being generated by the simulation. By clicking this tab, the user can take a quick look at the data or click the Download button to download a .csv copy of the table.

#### Future Updates
Currently, the plan is to continue developing a variety of multi-user functionalities. Additions such as a group chat/log, as well as allowing users to choose a personal chip color are coming. Ideally, a complete multiplayer update would also include methods to have active players democratically vote on ending a round of betting and spinning the roulette wheel.
